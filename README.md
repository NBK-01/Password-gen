# Password Generator

 ### This Generator was made using vanilla javascript for functionality, html for structure, and css for that splash of color!


## What does it do?
    1. Asks the user to pick from 8-128 characters.
    2. Asks the user if they want to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or special characters (or all of them)
    3. The script written will then randomly generate a password for the user and display it on the screen
